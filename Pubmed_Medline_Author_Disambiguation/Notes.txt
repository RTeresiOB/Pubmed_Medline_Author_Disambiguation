This notes file will be used to enter in notes to myself  while updating the script.

ENCODING = UTF-8
DELIMITER for set variables is '/'
DELIMITER for .csv is ','

// cGroup_Value is a list of const cRecord pointers. This definition will be used throughout the whole project.

Left off at Disambigmain.cpp line 492
** To DO:
- Install IBM CPLEX on cluster (Installed on local computer)
- Add conditional on whether or not to correct for fname frequency into disambiguate by set.
    Also add the parameter into the EngineConfig file (read from there into fetch_Records from txt function)
- DONE (not test, but have seen  it work): Create unit test try catch added for cAssignee::configure_assignee()

- DONE: DisambigCustomizedDefs.cpp is where attribute compare functions defined. 
        (Check class hierarchies for default functions on single mode and set mode - checked. Inherited from base classes)
    - Comparison functions are virtual functions within the base classes for each attribute type.
        They must be declared and overridden in the concrete classes for customized behavior.
- Implement Email matching. 
    - Matching emails have manually assigned r-values.
    - This should be implemented after initial run-through.


ALGORITHM CHANGE:
Instead of implementing custom similarity profiles in the cases that emails match, I will block records primarily on 
email matches (then first names) and add email addresses to the match lists for personal attributes.

Need to figure out where to look up same article. (Something like, if articleID is not the same, not a match.)

Template Classes Introduced and defined in DisambigDefs.h/cpp

Template Classes/Base Classes Notes:
    cAttribute:
        Usually made as a pointer (is this to easily attach to cRecord?)

DELIMITER: Delimiter on text reading function separates by the ',' character. Need to decide whether to change this to a different character,
           or replace ',' characters in our data. (Not sure if we will actually have any ','s. Definitely check this before running.)
Concrete classes (the classes where actual data are held) are introduced and defined in DisambigCustomizedDefs.h/cpp

I wrote updated comparison functions somewhere in this folder, but am not sure where they are (find them - FOUND). 
    I believe they aren't actually attached to the running of the script, though. I think I have to import them
        into their respective classes.

PUBMED/MEDLINE implementation has no interactive variables (such as cLatitude and cLongitude).
    I am relatively certain that the script will run fine without them (and any  other variables not included),
        however this is something to test.


Compiling the code does not work. Lots of small errors (such as not declaring variables/declaring them twice). 
    Genuinely not sure why these are happening considering that the original author seems to have been confident that 
        the script was functioning. It is possibly a matter of an updated GNU compiler (original script finished in 2013?).

cUnique_Record_ID's could perhaps have its class name changed to PMID (DisambigDefs.cpp). Not sure about this at the moment.
