This notes file will be used to enter in notes to myself  while updating the script.

// cGroup_Value is a list of const cRecord pointers. This definition will be used throughout the whole project.

Left off at Disambigmain.cpp line 492
** To DO:
- Install IBM CPLEX on cluster
- Not sure, but possible print a record other than what's at the top of the source file at the end of fetch
  records from text. 
- Test try catch added for cAssignee::configure_assignee()
- DisambigCustomizedDefs.cpp is where attribute compare functions defined. 
        (Check class hierarchies for default functions on single mode and set mode)
- Implement Email matching.

Template Classes Introduced and defined in DisambigDefs.h/cpp

Template Classes/Base Classes Notes:
    cAttribute:
        Usually made as a pointer (is this to easily attach to cRecord?)

DELIMITER: Delimiter on text reading function separates by the ',' character. Need to decide whether to change this to a different character,
           or replace ',' characters in our data. (Not sure if we will actually have any ','s. Definitely check this before running.)
Concrete classes (the classes where actual data are held) are introduced and defined in DisambigCustomizedDefs.h/cpp

I wrote updated comparison functions somewhere in this folder, but am not sure where they are (find them). 
    I believe they aren't actually attached to the running of the script, though. I think I have to import them
        into their respective classes.

PUBMED/MEDLINE implementation has no interactive variables (such as cLatitude and cLongitude).
    I am relatively certain that the script will run fine without them (and any  other variables not included),
        however this is something to test.


Compiling the code does not work. Lots of small errors (such as not declaring variables/declaring them twice). 
    Genuinely not sure why these are happening considering that the original author seems to have been confident that 
        the script was functioning. It is possibly a matter of an updated GNU compiler (original script finished in 2013?).

cUnique_Record_ID's could perhaps have its class name changed to PMID (DisambigDefs.cpp). Not sure about this at the moment.
